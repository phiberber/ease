# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Ease Repository!

Ease is a Strong Dynamically Typed programming language! If Tabnine guesses your next lines, Ease will be able to guess your next types.

## Philosophy
Our main objective is to create a programming language that can run both as a compiled and interpreted language. We like to keep things simple, here is our philosophy:

- Remove the most possible of the syntax, and make the syntax tags different from each other as possible.
- Be a language that can run everywhere, without any proper installation.
- Be a language that any beginner can understand.
- Be the fastest possible, humans can make mistakes, but most of the time, we can solve them automatically.

## Write once run everywhere
Currently, to focus on the syntax itself. Ian will be transpiled to Javascript, so we can already work with it on the web, desktop and mobile. In the future, we want to implement WebAssembly through LLVM

## Objectives
- The most syntax sugar possible.
- Hot Reload out of the box
- WORA
