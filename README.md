# Ian Programming Language

Welcome to the Ian's programming language repository!

Ian was created mainly to solve some issues with popular programming languages, it is an amazing programming language for people who's learning how to code, as it supports both indentation and brackets, students won't have to worry about forgetting a brackets or something like that.

Ian is an Obejct Oriented and Statically Typed programming language, inspired by the most popular languages.

## Running Ian on Web

Ian's compiler will support WebAssembly, with that you will be able to execute Ian scripts inside the browser! And even better, with hot-reload enabled! 

## Hot Reload

One of Ian's differential is the hability to hot-reload right out of the box, we coded Ian so function and class codes could be changed in real-time without the need of any type of restart. Isn't that amazing?

## How to Build

Currently as Ian isn't finished yet we aren't focusing on telling people how to build it (as the process may change through the days). 

## Demos

Currently we don't have any type of Demo available as Ian hasn't evolved that much.
