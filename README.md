# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Ease Repository!

Ease is a Strong Dynamically Typed programming language! If Tabnine your next lines, Ease will be able to guess your next types.

## Philosophy
Our main objective is to create a programming language that can run both as a compild and interpreted language. We like to keep things simple, here is our philosophy:

- Remove everything that isn't needed, even if it is part of the syntax.
- Be a language that can run everywhere, without any proper installation.
- Be a language that any beginner can understand.
- Be the fastest possible, humans can make mistakes, but most of the times, we can solve them automatically.

## Write once run everywhere
Currently, to focus on the syntax itself. Ian will be transpiled to Javascript, so we can already work with it on the web, desktop and mobile. In the future, we want to implement WebAssembly through LLVM

## Objectives
- The most syntax sugar possible.
- Hot Reload out of the box
- WORA

## I want to be a part of it
The first thing you can do is help we deciding a new name for the language, just comment your ideas on this issue: https://github.com/phiberber/ian-lang/issues/1
